# K-means-ClusteringGrouping-Universities-into-Public-and-Private
In this, I have tried to group universities into 2 groups public and private. For this, I have used K-means clustering for the purpose.

I used a data frame with 777 observations on the following 18 variables:
-Private-> A factor with levels No and Yes indicating private or public university <br />
-App->   Number of applications received<br />
-Accept-> Number of applications accepted<br />
-Enroll-> Number of new students enrolled<br />
-Top10perc -> Pct.new students from top 10% of H.S. class<br />
-Top25perc -> Pct.new students from top 25% of H.S. class<br />
-F.Undergrad-> Number of fulltime undergraduates<br />
-P.Undergrad-> Number of parttime undergraduates<br />
-Outstate-> Out-of-state tuition<br />
-Room.Board-> Room and board costs<br />
-Books-> Estimated book costs<br />
-Personal-> Estimated personal spending<br />
-PhD -> Pct.of faculty with Ph.D.â€™s<br />
-Terminal -> Pct.of faculty with terminal degree<br />
-S.F.Ratio-> Student/faculty ratio<br />
-perc.alumni -> Pct. alumni who donate<br />
-Expend-> Instructional expenditure per student<br />
-Grad.Rate-> Graduation rate<br />
